# Zaragoza-HW-Wk5-DayPlanner

In this repository you will find files for a day planner to be used for a standard 9-5 work day. The application allows users to input a brief event description
per hour and then save their events by clicking the checkmark icon next to each time block. Using a mix of jQuery and Bootstrap/CSS, each time block is recolored to
represent whether each event has passed, is currently ongoing, or will happen later in the day. Event descriptions will remain unless edited and re-saved.
